The "Find All Anagrams in a String" problem involves searching for all occurrences of anagrams of a given non-empty string p within a larger string s. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as "cinema" and "iceman." In this problem, you are required to find all starting indices of anagrams of p in s.

Problem Statement:
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the starting indices of anagrams of p in s.

Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0, 6]
Explanation:
The substring with starting index 0 is "cba," which is an anagram of "abc."
The substring with starting index 6 is "bac," which is an anagram of "abc

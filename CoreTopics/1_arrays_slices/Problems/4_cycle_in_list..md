The "Detect a Cycle in a Linked List" problem involves determining whether a linked list contains a cycle or not. A cycle in a linked list occurs when a node in the list points to a previous node, creating a loop. Detecting a cycle is important for avoiding infinite loops and identifying potential issues in linked list implementations.

#Problem Statement:
Given a linked list, determine whether it contains a cycle.

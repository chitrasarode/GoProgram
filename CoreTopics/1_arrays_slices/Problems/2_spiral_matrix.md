The Spiral Matrix problem involves traversing a 2D matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving in a clockwise direction. The task is to return all elements of the matrix in the order of their traversal. Here's a more detailed explanation:

# Problem Statement:
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

# Example:
Consider the following 3x3 matrix:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The spiral order traversal of this matrix would be [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5].

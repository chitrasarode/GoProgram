Correctness: 4/5

The program is correct and effectively counts the number of lines in the specified text file.
It correctly uses bufio.NewReader for efficient line-by-line reading.
However, there's a small issue with error handling. The err variable inside the loop shadows the err variable declared outside the loop, and it might lead to confusion. It's better to declare a new variable inside the loop to avoid this shadowing.
Complexity: 3/5

The program is relatively simple and achieves the goal.
It could benefit from more descriptive error messages. Instead of just printing "Errror in opening file," you can provide more information about the specific error that occurred, such as the file name or the nature of the error.
Consider checking for errors after the loop to handle errors that might occur during the reading process.
Here's an improved version of your code:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var count int

	file, err := os.Open("File1.txt")
	defer file.Close()

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		return
	}

	reader := bufio.NewReader(file)
	for {
		_, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
		count++
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
	}

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Total number of lines in File: ", count)
}
This version improves error messages and checks for errors after the loop to handle potential reading errors more effectively.

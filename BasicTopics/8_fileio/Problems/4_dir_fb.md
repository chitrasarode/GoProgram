I'll provide feedback on correctness and complexity on a scale of 1 to 5:

Correctness: 4/5

The program correctly lists files and directories.
It correctly identifies directories and prints their contents.
However, the program uses file.Name() to read subdirectories, which might not work correctly if the subdirectory is not in the current working directory. To handle this, you should use filepath.Join to construct the full path to the subdirectory.
Complexity: 3/5

The program is relatively simple and straightforward, making it easy to understand.
However, it lacks error handling in some critical places. For example, there is no error handling for the initial os.ReadDir(".") call, which could fail if the specified root directory is not accessible.
It only prints the immediate children of directories, so it's a flat representation rather than a nested one. To represent a tree structure more accurately, you need to recursively traverse subdirectories.
Here's an updated version of your code with some improvements:
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func printDirectoryTree(root string, indent string) {
	files, err := os.ReadDir(root)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading directory:", err)
		return
	}

	for _, file := range files {
		fmt.Println(indent + file.Name())
		if file.IsDir() {
			printDirectoryTree(filepath.Join(root, file.Name()), indent+"  ")
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	root := "." // Change this to the desired root directory
	fmt.Println(root)
	printDirectoryTree(root, "  ")
}

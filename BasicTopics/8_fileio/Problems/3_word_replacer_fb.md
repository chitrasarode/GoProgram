Correctness: 2/5

The program has several issues. It doesn't properly handle errors, and there are potential panics due to nil references.
The file is opened with os.O_RDWR, but the code does not check whether the file is successfully opened or not. It proceeds even if there is an error in opening the file.
The defer file.Close() statement will not execute if there is an error in opening the file.
The code doesn't handle errors during file creation or writing properly.
There are commented-out sections that seem to be attempts to seek back to the beginning of the file, but they are incomplete and not used.
Complexity: 2/5

The program is relatively simple, but it lacks proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.
It could be simplified by using the ioutil.ReadFile and ioutil.WriteFile functions, which handle file reading and writing in a more concise manner.
The code could benefit from using functions to encapsulate different parts of the logic, making it more modular and easier to understand.
Here's an improved version of your code:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"strings"
)

func replaceAndWriteToFile(filePath, oldWord, newWord string) error {
	data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filePath)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error reading file: %v", err)
	}

	modifiedData := strings.ReplaceAll(string(data), oldWord, newWord)

	err = ioutil.WriteFile(filePath, []byte(modifiedData), 0666)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error writing file: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Data written successfully")
	return nil
}

func main() {
	filePath := "File3.txt"
	oldWord := "rajashri"
	newWord := "chitra"

	err := replaceAndWriteToFile(filePath, oldWord, newWord)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
This version uses ioutil.ReadFile and ioutil.WriteFile for simplified file reading and writing. It also encapsulates the functionality into a separate function, improving readability and maintainability. Proper error handling is implemented, and deferred closing of the file is not necessary with ioutil functions.

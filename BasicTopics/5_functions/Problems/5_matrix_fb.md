Sure, I'll provide feedback on both correctness and complexity.

Correctness: 5/5
The matrix multiplication function appears to be correctly implemented. It follows the standard algorithm for matrix multiplication, and the code looks well-structured. The result is stored in the arr3 matrix, and the final result is printed correctly.

Complexity: 3/5
The complexity of the matrix multiplication function is O(n^3), where n is the size of the matrices. This is because there are three nested loops, each iterating over the size of the matrices. While this is a standard complexity for matrix multiplication, it's worth noting that there are more optimized algorithms for large matrices (e.g., Strassen's algorithm) that can achieve better performance. However, for small matrices like the 3x3 matrices used in your example, this straightforward approach is acceptable. If you intend to handle larger matrices, you might want to explore more optimized algorithms.

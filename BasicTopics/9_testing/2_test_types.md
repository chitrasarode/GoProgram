There are various types of tests that serve different purposes in the software development lifecycle. Each type of test focuses on specific aspects of the application, helping ensure its quality and reliability. Here are some common types of tests:

1. Unit Tests:
Purpose: Verify the smallest units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, in isolation.
Scope: Focus on testing individual functions or methods.
Isolation: Dependencies are often mocked or stubbed to isolate the unit being tested.
Tooling: Utilizes Golang's built-in testing package.
2. Integration Tests:
Purpose: Verify the interactions and interfaces between different units or components.
Scope: Test the integration points between various parts of the application.
Isolation: Real components are often used to validate the interactions.
Tooling: Relies on Golang's built-in testing package for structuring and executing tests.
3. Functional Tests:
Purpose: Validate that the application functions as expected from an end-user perspective.
Scope: Test entire features or user scenarios.
Isolation: Often performed using real components without mocks.
Tooling: Golang's built-in testing package is commonly used for functional tests.
4. Regression Tests:
Purpose: Ensure that new changes don't negatively impact existing functionality.
Scope: Re-run existing tests after code changes to check for regressions.
Isolation: Cover critical paths and previously identified areas of risk.
Tooling: Typically integrated into automated test suites using various testing frameworks.
5. Performance Tests:
Purpose: Evaluate the performance characteristics of the system under specific conditions.
Types: Load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing.
Metrics: Response times, throughput, resource utilization, and scalability.
Tooling: Utilizes Golang's built-in testing package with the Benchmark prefix for performance benchmarks.
6. Security Tests:
Purpose: Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's security.
Types: Penetration testing, code analysis, and vulnerability scanning.
Focus: Authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure communication.
Tooling: Golang-compatible security testing libraries, such as gosec.
7. Usability Tests:
Purpose: Evaluate the user interface and overall user experience.
Methods: User surveys, interviews, and usability testing sessions.
Focus: Navigation, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
Tooling: Usability testing often involves manual testing with feedback.
8. Acceptance Tests:
Purpose: Verify that the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for release.
Scope: Entire application or specific features.
Isolation: May involve manual testing by QA teams.
Tooling: Golang-compatible acceptance testing libraries, such as Ginkgo or custom acceptance testing frameworks.
9. Exploratory Tests:
Purpose: Discover defects and areas of weakness by exploring the application.
Approach: Testers explore the application without predefined test cases.
Focus: Identify issues that may not be covered by scripted tests.
Tooling: Manual testing with the help of test management tools.
10. Smoke Tests:
- **Purpose:** Quickly verify that the most critical functionalities of the application work after a build.
- **Scope:** High-level tests covering key features.
- **Isolation:** Generally automated and executed after each build.
- **Tooling:** Part of continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

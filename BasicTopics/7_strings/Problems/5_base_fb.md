Sure, let's evaluate the program based on correctness and complexity:

Correctness: 5/5

The program correctly uses the encoding/base64 package to perform Base64 encoding and decoding.
It correctly converts a string to a byte slice before encoding and converts the decoded byte slice back to a string.
It checks for errors during the decoding process and prints an error message if there is an issue.
The program successfully demonstrates the encoding and decoding of a string using Base64.
Complexity: 4/5

The complexity is moderate.
The program effectively uses the encoding/base64 package, which simplifies the implementation significantly.
It correctly handles the conversion between string and byte slice, which is necessary for encoding and decoding.
The main complexity comes from the use of byte slices, which might be slightly confusing for someone not familiar with Go, but it's a reasonable choice in this context.
Overall, the program is correct, and the complexity is appropriate for a simple Base64 encoding and decoding demonstration. The use of the standard library (encoding/base64) makes the code concise and easy to understand.

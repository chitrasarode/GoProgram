In GoLang, basic data types are the fundamental building blocks for representing and manipulating values in a program. Here are the primary basic data types in GoLang:

1. Numeric Types:

int: Signed integers. The size depends on the platform (32 or 64 bits).
uint: Unsigned integers. The size also depends on the platform.
int8, int16, int32, int64: Signed integers of specific sizes (8, 16, 32, 64 bits).
uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64: Unsigned integers of specific sizes.
2. Floating-Point Types:

float32, float64: Floating-point numbers representing real numbers.
3. Complex Types:

complex64, complex128: Complex numbers with float32 and float64 real and imaginary parts.
4. Boolean Type:

bool: Represents true or false values.
String Type:

5. string: Represents a sequence of characters. Strings in Go are immutable.
6. Character Type:

byte (alias for uint8): Represents individual bytes (characters) in a string.
rune (alias for int32): Represents a Unicode code point. Used for representing characters in strings.
7. Derived Types:

Arrays: Fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type.
Slices: Dynamic, flexible views into arrays.
Structs: Composite data types that group together variables under a single name.
Pointers: Variables that store the memory address of another variable.
Maps: Key-value pairs where keys and values can be of any type.
Channels: Communication mechanism between goroutines for concurrent programming.
8. Special Types:

nil: Represents the zero value for pointers, interfaces, channels, maps, functions, and slices.
error: Represents an error condition. Commonly used as a return type for functions that may fail.
Here's a simple example illustrating the use of basic data types in GoLang:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Numeric types
    var integer int = 42
    var floatingPoint float64 = 3.14
    var isGoAwesome bool = true
    var text string = "Hello, Go!"

    fmt.Println("Integer:", integer)
    fmt.Println("Floating Point:", floatingPoint)
    fmt.Println("Boolean:", isGoAwesome)
    fmt.Println("String:", text)
}

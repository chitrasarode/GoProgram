Correctness: 5/5

Your FizzBuzz program appears to be correct. It follows the specified rules, printing "Fizz" for multiples of 
three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both three and five. 
The else case correctly prints the number for all other cases. Overall, the logic is sound, and the program 
achieves the desired output.

Complexity: 3/5

In terms of complexity, your implementation is relatively straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a 
simple loop to iterate from 1 to 100 and uses if-else statements to check the conditions for "Fizz," "Buzz," and 
"FizzBuzz." While the logic is clear and concise, there's room for improvement in terms of reducing redundancy. 
For example, the conditions for checking multiples of 3 and 5 could be combined into a single condition for 
"FizzBuzz," eliminating the need for an additional check in the first if statement. This would make the code 
slightly more concise. However, the current implementation is still effective and gets the job done.

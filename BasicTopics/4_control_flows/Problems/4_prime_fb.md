Feedback:
Correctness (4.5/5):
Positive Aspects:

The prime function correctly checks whether a given number is prime or not using a loop up to the square root of
 the input number, which is a common optimization.
The main program appropriately takes user input, calls the prime function, and prints whether the number is prime or not.
Potential Improvement:

The program does not handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value (e.g., a string) as input. Adding 
input validation for this scenario would enhance the robustness of your program.
Complexity (4/5):
Positive Aspects:

The complexity is relatively low, making it easy to understand.
The use of the square root for optimization is a good practice to reduce the number of iterations in the loop.
Potential Improvement:

You could further optimize the loop by starting from 2 and only checking odd numbers, as even numbers greater
 than 2 are not prime.
Overall Rating:
Your program is well-structured and correctly determines whether a given number is prime. Consider adding input 
validation for non-integer inputs to enhance robustness. Additionally, if you're interested in further
 optimization, you could explore starting the loop from 2 and only checking odd numbers. Good job overall!

Feedback:
Correctness (4.5/5):
Positive Aspects:

The program correctly implements the Rock, Paper, Scissors game logic.
It handles the cases of a tie and determines the winner based on the specified rules.
Random choices for the computer are generated appropriately.
Potential Improvement:

You may want to consider making the comparison case-insensitive to improve user experience. For example, converting both user choice and random choice to lowercase before comparison.
Complexity (4/5):
Positive Aspects:

The code is relatively simple and easy to understand.
The use of if-else statements for the game logic is clear and appropriate.
Potential Improvement:

As the program grows, you might want to consider organizing the code into functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, you could have a function to determine the winner based on the choices.
Overall Rating:
Your Rock, Paper, Scissors game is well-implemented, and the logic is correct. Consider making the comparison case-insensitive and organizing the code into functions for better structure. Good job overall!

Sure, let's evaluate the correctness and complexity of your code.

Correctness (4.5/5):
Your code is mostly correct and achieves the desired functionality. However, there's a minor improvement that
 can be made to enhance the user experience.

Positive Aspects:

The random number generation and the loop to prompt the user for guesses are correctly implemented.
The program correctly provides feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.
The loop breaks when the user guesses the correct number.
Improvement:

When the user enters a non-numeric value (e.g., a string), your program may not behave as expected. You could add
 input validation to handle such cases gracefully.

Complexity (3.5/5):
Your code is relatively simple, but there's room for improvement in terms of code organization and handling edge 
cases.

Positive Aspects:

The code is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for learners.
Proper use of a loop for repeated prompts until the correct guess.
Areas for Improvement:

Input validation: Adding input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number would make your program more
 robust.
You could consider breaking down your code into functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
While the simplicity is good for a basic program, you might want to explore more advanced features or error
 handling as you progress.
Overall Rating:
Your code is solid and achieves the core functionality. Consider incorporating input validation and organizing
 your code into functions to further improve its structure and robustness. Great job overall!
